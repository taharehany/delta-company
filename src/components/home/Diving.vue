                            p Those who are guided by stars in the pitch dark, enormously enjoy it while unearthing priceless treasures hidden underground. They relish what Time has left for us of inscriptions which date back to roots of legacy and dawn of history as a witness to legacy whose roots run deep in history and identity. Such legacy can be traced and seen in the form of now-buried peopleâ€™s laughter at the corners of houses; such smiles have been maintained on doors and windows in the form of inscriptions which you can talk with if you wish to.
